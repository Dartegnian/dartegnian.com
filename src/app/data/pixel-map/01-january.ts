  { status: "excellent", icon: "flare", title: "New Year's Day", reason: "Spent the early morning with someone. Prepared a gift idea. Had some time alone in a park to think about things and last year. Claimed Starbucks cold cup from sticker set." },
  { status: "above-average" },
  { status: "bad", icon: "sports_esports", reason: "Had a fight with a close, special person. They had a bad day, too, so that kind of snowballed onto me. We were okay within the same night, though." },

  { status: "bad", icon: "liquor", reason: "I went out with friends and then I got scolded by somebody. I wasn't there when they needed me. It felt like things were going to reset (once again) and I just wiped my entire Discord profile. I'm so scared of that \"1 mistake that changes everything\" from last year. Since I was with friends, I drank a lot with them." },
  { status: "below-average", reason: "Met up with friends at BGC and had some ramen. This would be my second-to-the-last time I would see my best friend before he leaves for the military. I was still in pain/shock from the day prior." },
  { status: "excellent", icon: "movie", title: "First Friends Outing Day", reason: "Gifted someone our anniversary gift! And had some fun alone time, teasing each other and making jokes. Watched movies with 1 group of friends, spent the evening with another group of friends. Said goodbye to my best friend and met their family again after years." },
  { status: "above-average", icon: "call", reason: "Spent the entire day on call with someone. It was cute, it's been a while since we've had a full day on call and just with each other, mostly." },
  { status: "excellent", icon: "heart_plus", title: "Anniversary", reason: "My 1st anniversary with someone! We had shared food the entire day: same breakfast and dinner. I opened up a lot of things with them and we looked back at our past." },
